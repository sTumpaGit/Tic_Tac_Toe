# Tic_Tac_Toe


This program displays a Tic Tac Toe game.  Play alternates
between the user and computer. If user plays O, the computer, which plays X.
After the game ends the program displays a dialog box announcing the
winner and the total number of wins, losses, and draws by the user, and
asks if the user wants to play again.  If the user clicks YES then the
screen is cleared and a new game started.  Otherwise the program exits.
The computer moves first on alternate games.
